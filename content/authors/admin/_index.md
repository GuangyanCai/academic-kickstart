I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Irvine School of Information and Computer Science, working with [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/). I am interested in physics-based rendering and differentiable rendering. 

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I worked with [Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/).
